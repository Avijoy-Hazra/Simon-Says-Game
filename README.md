#Simon Says Game
#Description:
Simon Says is a classic memory game where players must repeat a sequence of colors or sounds that the game presents. This version of Simon Says is a web-based implementation using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It's a fun and challenging game that tests your memory and reflexes!

#Features:
Randomized sequences: The game generates random sequences of colors for the player to memorize and repeat.
Increasing difficulty: As players progress through the game, the sequences become longer and more challenging.
Sound and visual feedback: Each color in the sequence is accompanied by both a sound and a visual cue to help players remember.
Score tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, allowing them to compete against themselves or others for high scores.
#How to Play:
Open the game in a web browser that supports HTML and JavaScript.
Click or tap the "Start" button to begin the game.
Watch and listen carefully as the game presents a sequence of colors.
Once the sequence is complete, use your mouse or touchscreen to click or tap the colors in the same order.
If you repeat the sequence correctly, the game will add another color to the sequence and increase your score.
If you make a mistake, the game will end, and your final score will be displayed.
#Technologies Used:
HTML: Provides the structure and layout of the game.
CSS: Styles the game elements to make it visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including generating sequences, handling user input, and updating the score.
